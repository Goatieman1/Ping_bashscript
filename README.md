# Ping_bashscript
Bash script I wrote to repeatedly ping any three ip addresses and write the results out to a results file. 

It can be further amended to include more ip addresses fairly simply.

It can also be amended to only run once when called and then exit by removing the while loop or the interval of pings it does can also be amended easily by changing the number of seconds it sleeps for.
