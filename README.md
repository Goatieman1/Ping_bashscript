# Ping_bashscript
Bash script I wrote to repeatedly ping any three ip addresses and write the results out to a results file. 

It can be further amended to include more ip addresses fairly simply.

It can also be amended to only run once when called and then exit or the interval of pings it does can also be amended easily. 

Instructions for use... 

1-Place this file in chosen director

2-Add the ip addresses you want to ping and save the file

3-Run the chmod command to make file executable 

4-call it from the terminal 

5-Additional steps...

6-time between pings can be changed (see sleep part of while loop) 

7-Or to have it execute only when called from the terminal, remove the while loop from around the function call.
